            <h1>ENET Care Medication Tracking System</h1>
            <p>
                ENET Care is an international charity. The charity provides medications and vaccines to remote communities.
            ENET Care works by establishing distribution centres in remote communities. A distribution centre is a building (or a tent) with storage shelves, a solar-powered refrigerator and satellite internet. Distribution centres receive and store packages containing medications. Doctors at distribution centres take packages from storage and give the medications to needy people.
            Delivery and storage in remote distribution centres is very challenging. ENET Care does not track its medications. However, management believes that many shipments of medications are being lost, damaged, discarded or stolen. ENET Care would like to reduce losses. They would like to track packages and use tracking information to identify problems in their supply chain.
